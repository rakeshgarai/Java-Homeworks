DAY 12 ASSIGNMENT DONE


1)What do you mean by an Array?
ANS:
 It refers to index collection of fixed no of homogeneous data elements.It is an important concept in java,where you store multiple values.


2)How to create an Array?
ANS:


To create an array, define the data type(like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets[].To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces: int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100}; We have now created a variable that holds an array of four integers.


3)Can we change the size of an array at run time?
ANS:


You can't change the size of the array after it's constructed.


4)Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
ANS:
Yes. We can declare an array without size but before using it needs to be initialised.


5)What is the default value of the array?
 ANS: 0


6)What is a 1D array with an example?
ANS:
 Which arrays have one row and multiple columns is called 1D array.
Ex:
public class main
{
public static void main(String[]args)
{
          Int nums[]={2,3,4,5};
        System.out.println(nums[0]);
        System.out.println(nums[1]);
        System.out.println(nums[2]);
        System.out.println(nums[3]);
}
}


7)Write a program on a 2D array?
ANS:
Public class Array2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
      int nums [] []= new int [3] [2];
      nums[0][0] = 5;
      nums[0][1] = 2;
      nums[1][0] = 8;
      nums[1][1] = 2;
      nums[2][0] = 9;
      nums[2][1] = 5;


       
      for(int i=0;i<=2; i++)
      {
        for(int j=0;j<=1;j++)
        {
            System.out.print(nums[i] [j] + " ");


            
        }
        System.out.println();
        
      }


    }
